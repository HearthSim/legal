# List of Third Parties

As part of our operations and in order to provide you with our services, we
sometimes need to share data with third parties.
This is never done with malicious intent but simply because those third
parties provide us with services we require in order to operate; such as
hosting, billing, analytics, etc.

HearthSim is not in the business of selling your personal data.
We provide the following list in order to maximize transparency.

This list, to the best of our knowledge, is accurate as of **2020-03-08**.
