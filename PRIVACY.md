# HSReplay.net Privacy Policy

As with most online services, you trust us with your data when you use our
website. This privacy policy is here to help you understand what information
we collect, how we store it and what we do with it. If you have any questions
or concerns about this policy or your data in general, email us at
<privacy@hearthsim.net> and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

We aim to be as transparent as possible. To that end, we made the HSReplay.net
website open source. We run an unmodified version of the code that is
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/HearthSim/HSReplay.net) for everyone
to see.

As of March 2017, the source document of this Privacy Policy is hosted
[on GitHub](https://github.com/HearthSim/legal/blob/master/PRIVACY.md). You may
find its edit history there.

The last update to this document (excluding formatting changes, typo fixes, etc)
was on **2017-03-16**.


## HSReplay.net accounts

### Account data

There are two types of accounts on HSReplay.net: Anonymous and Regular.

Anonymous accounts consist of an autogenerated
[UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) we call an
"Authentication Token" and that is it. They are a convenient way of sending us
game replays semi-anonymously without creating an account beforehand.

Regular accounts are created when you first sign into the website, such as from
[the home page](https://hsreplay.net/). We use the
[Battle.net OAuth2 API](https://dev.battle.net/docs/read/oauth) in order to
delegate authentication to Battle.net, and then automatically create a
corresponding account for you. The **only** data sent by the Battle.net API is
your Battletag and your Battle.net Account ID; both are stored in order to
enable you to log in.
**HSReplay.net does not receive any type of personally-identifiable information
from Battle.net such as passwords, names, emails, addresses or billing data.**
You may view and manage your social account connections from
[the Connections page](https:///hsreplay.net/account/social/connections/).

HSReplay.net will store your email address if you provide it to us. We may use
it to contact you for account-related matters, or occasionally for marketing
purposes (eg. to announce new features). You may opt out of receiving such
marketing emails by going to your
[email settings page](https://hsreplay.net/account/email/).

Regardless of your settings, your email is never shared to third parties for
non-essential purposes. In other words, we don't sell your email addresses.
Your billing email may be shared with [Stripe](https://stripe.com), our
payment partner, so that you can receive invoices when you make payments on
the website. Stripe is a well-known and trusted payment provider with an
excellent reputation and track record, they do not spam their users nor do
anything nefarious with the emails.

You may view and manage your associated email addresses from
[the email settings page](https://hsreplay.net/account/email/).


### Billing data

We use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to allow for payments on HSReplay.net.
Stripe is a secure payment provider, trusted by
[thousands of online businesses](https://stripe.com/customers). When you input
a credit card number on HSReplay.net, you are directly communicating it to
Stripe; HSReplay.net does not ever see or store your full credit card number.

In order to provide you with billing management features, we store a backup of
small amounts of data that Stripe gives us access to. This includes the last 4
digits of your credit card numbers as well as your payment history with the
website. **We do not store your name nor any sensitive payment information** as
part of this process.


### Account deletion

You may request to delete your account from the "Delete account" section of
your [account page](https://hsreplay.net/account/). Upon doing so, your account
will be marked for deletion and you will no longer be able to log into it.
All account data will be irreversibly wiped within the following 7 days.
Uploaded replays will be detached from the account and will only be reachable
via links you may have previously shared. However, you can elect to to have
them deleted as well.

Please note that deleting your account will not delete your associated payment
history with us.


### Hearthstone Deck Tracker

[Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://hsdecktracker.net) (HDT) is our official
replay upload client. Whenever you finish a game of Hearthstone with HDT
running, the game's log is automatically uploaded to HSReplay.net. You can
disable those uploads in HDT itself, in `options › tracker › replays`.

By default, HDT also sends some basic usage statistics to our servers upon
starting the application and completing a game.
We use this data _only in aggregate_ to help us understand how our users use
the software. To disable this from HDT, go to `options › tracker › settings`
and check off _Submit anonymous data_.


## Replay data

Whenever an upload is made to HSReplay.net, the following data is sent to us
and saved on our servers:

* The uploader's IP address, for the purpose of curation (such as to ban
  badly-behaving clients).
* Optionally, game metadata such as game and client IDs, game server IP, etc.
* The `Power.log` file generated by the game ("the log file").

The log file contains only gameplay data. However, player definitions contain a
unique _Hearthstone account ID_ (this is different from the Battle.net account
ID obtained during signup), as well as a _player name_. The player name is
usually the "name" portion of a Battletag. As of March 2017, the player's real
name is never included in the log file.


### Statistics and game analysis

One of our goals in the creation of this service is to understand Hearthstone
and its metagame. The strong diversity of backgrounds in the
[HearthSim Developer Community](https://hearthsim.info/) puts us in the unique
position to be able to analyze the game as nobody has ever done before.
Our intention is to contribute that data back to the community in various ways
such as blog posts, APIs, and interactive features. Some of these features are
monetized, in order to help us keep the replay service free and to ensure the
continued development of the many free tools in the HearthSim community such as
Hearthstone Deck Tracker.

You can elect to opt all your new uploads out of such analyses and any public
archive from [your account page](https://hsreplay.net/account/), under the
_Statistics contributions_ section.


## Other information

Our servers are hosted in Northern Virginia in the United States of America, on
the [Amazon Web Services infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/).
All replays are stored on [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) in the same region.

Our servers log requests across our web pages and APIs for the purposes of
debugging only. None of those logs contain any personally-identifiable
information and they are all destroyed once they become irrelevant within the
first 60 days after they are written.

We use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) to understand how our
users use the website. All data is anonymous. HSReplay.net respects the
[Do Not Track standard](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/dnt/) and does not
serve Google Analytics to browsers sending this header.
If you are concerned with usage tracking on the internet, we recommend the
[EFF's Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) browser extension.
